Java:

>Object oriented programming
>Portable - write once, compile once and run everywhere
>Java does not run on native processor, but it runs on a virtual machine called , JVM. JVM runs on the top of our
    native operating system.Because of this abstraction, java compiled byte code can run on any machine as long as
    it has JVM installed on it.
>very popular on server side applications


what are some features of java:

1>Simple, object oriented and familiar
2>Robust and secure
3>Architecture neutral due to concept of JVM
4>High Performance and portable
5>Interpreted, dynamic(type definition is static though),multithreaded

JVM(Java Virtiual Machine):
==============================

1>It is the runtime VM , in which a java program is run.
2>Takes the compiled java bytecode and runs it.
3>Has a specification , that outlines how it should work
4>There are multiple implementation of JVM available in the market, which are build on specification defined for JVM.
5>Essential in making java platform independent.

JRE:
===========================
1>Stands for Java Runtime environment.
2>It is a set of software element, which together run a java application on a machine
3>it consists of
        >ClassLoader
        >JVM
        >Libraries and utilities
4>JRE orchestrates activities between these software element to run java application. For eg, it will ask the classloader to
 load the java classes and once classes are loaded, it will will take the bytecode and ask the JVM to run it.

5>Installed on the machine, where java application needs to run.

What is JDK:
==================

1>Stands for Java Development kit
2>It is a set of tool to help developers write java code.
3>Comes with JRE(because we need to run, what we develop)
4>Based on java language specification
3>It includes:
    >Java compiler
    >Class library
    >Utility(like linker,loader etc.)

difference between JRE,jvm,JDK:
=======================================
JDK: SOFTWARE used for building java applications
JRE: SOFTWARE used for running java applications. If we just want to run a java execuatble, we don't need JDK.
JVM: ABSTRACT VIRTUAL MACHINE that JRE spins up to run the java application 'in'.
